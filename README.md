# Viridian

Viridian is a gamified productivity app designed to motivate developers by nurturing a virtual exotic tree garden. As you engage in your GitHub workflow (commits, pull requests, etc.), you earn XP that helps you unlock trees and grow your virtual garden showcasing GitHub consistency.

## How it works
- After signup into the application, the application reads GitHub activity data like commits, pr's, etc, and generates xp points based on that data. The XP points are then used to unlock virtual exotic trees, each with unique Characteristics.
- These trees are then used to generate a forest, the forest signifies GitHub activity, the thicker your virtual forest( more trees), the higher your activities on github
